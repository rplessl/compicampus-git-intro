# Welcome to the CompiCampus Dive in to Git and GitHub or GitLab

Welcome to my CompiCampus "Dive in to Git and GitHub / GitLab" Classroom from 2023-03-29!

I set up the course like this:

First there will be an input about Git, GitHub / GitLab including some details about the history and design goals of Git. Then you can take the inputs, learn the most important Git commands and follow the exercises for Git and GitHub from the slide deck. With the goal to learn how to use both Web and command line tools.

The second part of the course will be in the form of an accompanied exercise.

Have fun discovering Git and GitLab/GitHub with it's overwhelming features :smile:!

Cheers, Roman
